In this program [Responsive Login Form], at first, on the webpage, there is a login form with a login title, two input fields with icons used for email and password, a login button, and two hyperlinks for forget password and signup [to making new account]. This form is created using only HTML & CSS and I have not add JavaScript function in this program[ login form] so when you filled up your login details [email and password] and submit the form, it won't submit your details anywhere.
